Free and open-source tool for Honkai: Star Rail that allows you to dump offsets for almost all methods found in `GameAssembly.dll` in the json format. The program is developed as an internal module that's being loaded into the game process. Compatible only with the global version of the game.

## FAQ

### How to load the tool?
I am not providing any builds of this program, so if you want to try it out you will have to compile it yourself. Once you do that, you can use the loader from my other program, [Genshin Utility](https://github.com/lanylow/genshin-utility), to load this tool into the game.

### How do I know if it worked?
About 10 seconds after injecting the tool into the game a console should show up. Once you see a message saying `done` in it, a file called `methods.json` should appear in the same folder where the game (`StarRail.exe`) is installed.

### Why are some methods just random characters?
Many methods inside the game are obfuscated by developers in order to make reverse engineering harder. There is very little you can do about it, and it's not the purpose of this program.

## Example output

Here are a few lines from the file generated by this tool.
